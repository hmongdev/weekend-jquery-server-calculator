# PROJECT NAME

weekend-jquery-server-calculator.js

## Description

_Duration: 8 hours_

Description:
In this project, we learned how to:

1. Create a user interface
2. Grab user input
3. Select the type of mathematical operation the user wants
4. Click a submit button that captures the user inputs, bundles it in an object, and sends the object to the server using POST method
5. Server logic should perform calculations and store the new result
6. Then use a GET method to retrieve the data from the server and display a history of the results on the DOM

What problem did you solve? How did you solve it?

1. Creating server logic to calculate the inputs. I first approached this by creating 4 separate if statements, then 4 functions. In the end, I solved this issue by creating a switch statement. Then storing the result of the calcuation in a new object that would be returned to the client upon a GET request.
